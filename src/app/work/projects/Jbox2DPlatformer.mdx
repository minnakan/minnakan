summary: "Developed a pirate themed 2D platformer game using Java and JBox 2D, filled with dynamic sprites and engaging mechanics. The game features sound effects and projectiles alongside multiple levels that introduce a variety of enemies. To keep things exciting, I added collectible items scattered throughout the levels, rewarding players as they progress. The final level includes a boss battle with unique mechanics."
