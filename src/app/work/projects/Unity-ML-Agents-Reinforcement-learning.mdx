title: "Unity - ML Agents Reinforcement learning"
publishedAt: "https://github.com/minnakan/UnityMLAgents_CustomAlgorithms"
summary: "This project explores reinforcement learning (RL) techniques in Unity using ML-Agents and OpenAI Gym. Various algorithms such as Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) were implemented to train agents in five simulated environments: Basic, 3D Balance Ball, Grid World, Push Block, and Worm. The project focused on benchmarking agent performance, achieving impressive results in tasks like balance control, navigation, and object manipulation within complex environments."
